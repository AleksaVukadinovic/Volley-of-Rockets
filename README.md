# Tornado Projectile Simulation

This project is a **3D simulation of projectile motion influenced by a tornado vortex**, created as part of the **"Introduction to Mechanics" course** at the **Faculty of Mathematics, University of Belgrade**. It was developed by a team of two students: **Aleksa Vukadinoviƒá** and **Masa Laziƒá**, to explore and visualize complex motion under the influence of wind and air resistance.

## üåÄ Overview

The simulation models the motion of multiple projectiles launched into a **tornado-like wind field**, taking into account:

- **Gravitational acceleration**
- **Air resistance (drag force)**
- **Wind velocity field (circular, tornado-shaped vortex)**

Each projectile has randomized initial speed and launch angle (except for one reference projectile), and their resulting trajectories are visualized in a 3D plot.

The tornado's wind behaves as a **circular vector field** that varies depending on the projectile's distance from the tornado's center. The airflow is modeled to decrease outside the tornado's radius and increase inside it.

## üì∏ Example Output

The simulation produces a 3D plot where:

- The **reference trajectory** is highlighted in **red**.
- All other projectiles are colored based on their **initial speed**.
- The **impact points** are marked with crosses.
- A **circular tornado disk** and **vector field arrows** represent the wind field.

## üì¶ Features

- Accurate modeling of **drag force** proportional to velocity squared.
- Realistic tornado wind model using a radial vector field.
- Clear 3D visualization of all trajectories and wind field.
- Color-mapped initial speeds with a legend.
- Interactive view using `matplotlib`‚Äôs 3D toolkit.

## üöÄ How to Run

### 1. Requirements

Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed with the following libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

### 2. Run the Simulation

```bash
python simulation.py
```

You'll be prompted to enter the number of additional projectiles to simulate:

```txt
Enter the number of additional projectiles: 15
```

After input, the simulation will run and a 3D plot will be displayed.
